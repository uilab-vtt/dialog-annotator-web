There\u2019s only one Ryan Gosling. Women want him. Men want to be him. Most Tumblr blogs are about him. No mere Hollywood pretty boy, he\u2019s symbolic of everything modern manhood should aspire to. Did you see The Notebook? Exactly. Packed with trivia, jokes, and over 100 full-color photos that graphically illustrate his physical perfection, 100 Reasons to Love Ryan Gosling provides scientifically irrefutable evidence of exactly why Ryan is so damn loveable.Is it because he takes his mom to film premieres? Plays in a hip indie band? Carries his dog through airports? Breaks up street fights? Furthered the feminist cause without even trying? Has no problem with nudity even when the script doesn\u2019t strictly require it? It\u2019s all these things \u0097 and more."}, {"id": "B00XQ9RNVQ", "genre": "Children's Books", "title": "Dognapped (Childrens Picture Book Series #1)", "description": "Dognapped is an adorable children\u2019s picture book comprising 13 beautiful illustrations about an adventurous and adorable dog Jack who lives in a red and yellow house in Aberdeen, Scotland.A great book that can be read to those younger than 5, a read alone or with guidance book for kids age 5-8, or as a read alone tale for kids 9-12 who are looking for a new sort of hero.
