After some decisions a select Battalion sized element, Second Squadron was developed to execute that decision. 2/4 Cavalry, being part of the Kommando since Book 5: Eagle Hammer was brought in to perform this mercenary themed short story. The story is based on the real world template that became known to the world as Black Hawk Down. Given that Operation Gothic Serpent was the actual name I chose to write the mission according to the plans and execution of that fateful mission. However instead of retreading the whole operation and what happened (As I did in Book 3: Another Day In Paradise) this is a more successful outcome."}, {"id": "0575076836", "genre": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "title": "Provender Gleed", "description": "The Families.O Insanely rich and richly insane.O With world-spanning business interests, glamour and power, they are monarchs, Mafia and movie stars rolled into one.O Since theOBorgias and de'Medicis united in the 17th century,Othe FamiliesOhave transfixed, transformed, and ruled, the world.

The insights Cohen provides into subculture and mass morality are as relevant today as they were when the book was originally published in 1972, as illustrated by the author's introduction for this new edition, in which he tracks moral panics over the last thirty years, commenting on the demonization of young offenders and asylum seekers and on the News of the World's 'name and shame' campaign against paedophiles.Revisiting the theory of moral panic and exploring the way in which the concept has been used, this new edition features a select bibliography of key texts for further reading. The third edition of Folk Devils and Moral Panics makes available a valuable and widely recommended text."}, {"id": "B076KP8DB4", "genre": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "title": "Doormaker: Tower of Shadows (Book 2)", "description": "Maella has broken the one family rule\u2014to never open a door.
