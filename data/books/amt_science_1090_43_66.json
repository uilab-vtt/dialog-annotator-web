The Germans have won World War II; America is a nuclear wasteland; and worst of all the breakfast menu at The Wife's Legs Caf\u00e9 in Brentford is serving bratwurst rather than the proper British sausage. When the world is all wrong and it needs setting right, the only hope left is Hugo Rune, a man who offers the world his genius and asks only that his expenses be covered. Hugo, also known as the hokus bloke, the Lad Himself, and the Retromancer, sets out to rewrite history the way it should be, with the aid of his faithful acolyte and companion Rizla. Together they return to war-torn London to solve the\u00a012 cosmic conundrums based upon Hugo's personal tarot deck, each mystery leading them closer to a final terrifying confrontation. They must match their wits against beautiful spies, advanced alien technology, killer robots, and death rays; do battle with an ancient god; and come face to face once more with Hugo Rune's arch-enemy, the sinister Count Otto Black."}, {"id": "B0776YKSM8", "genre": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "title": "THE 100 DEATHS OF LUCAS GRAVES (5 Book Series)", "description": "From Book 1: Lucas Graves is a laid-back millennial, who has glided through life thus far by making a habit out of avoiding trouble at all costs.
