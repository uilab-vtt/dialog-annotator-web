Caring for soldiers' wounds and writing letters home for them inspired a new realism in her work. When her own letters home were published as Hospital Sketches, she had her first success as a writer. The acclaim for her new writing style inspired her to use this approach in Little Women, which was one of the first novels to be set during the Civil War. It was the book that made her dreams come true, and a story she could never have written without the time she spent healing others in service of her country."}, {"id": "B0765ZYJWD", "genre": "Children's Books", "title": "Best 25 Recipes of Delicious Pies with Fruits: quick and easy recipes", "description": "*** Buy your copy now in English, German, French, Spanish, Italian, or Portuguese ***Fruits contain many important vitamins for human health, especially for children,To give your family this fruit in a lovely way,This book present to you the best 25 quick and easy recipes to prepare Delicious pies with fruit."}, {"id": "B00HOZGHS8", "genre": "Children's Books", "title": "Davy, the Wild Little Donkey and the Wonderful Thing that he Did: a Palm Sunday story", "description": "A child's Bible story about Palm Sunday as told through the eyes of the unbroken donkey himself.
