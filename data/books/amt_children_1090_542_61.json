But Maddy knows that a small bit of magic has survived. The \u201cruinmark\u201d she was born with on her palm proves it\u2013and makes the other villagers fearful that she is a witch (though helpful in dealing with the goblins-in-the-cellar problem). But the mysterious traveler One-Eye sees Maddy\u2019s mark not as a defect, but as a destiny. And Maddy will need every scrap of forbidden magic One-Eye can teach her if she is to survive that destiny."}, {"id": "0635015471", "genre": "Children's Books", "title": "General George C.
