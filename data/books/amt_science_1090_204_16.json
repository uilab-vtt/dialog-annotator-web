[{"id": "B01HRHZXEQ", "genre": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "title": "By Bizarre Hands (Dover Horror Classics)", "description": "\"Lansdale is an immense talent.\" \u2014 Booklist. Small-town juvenile delinquents, Pentecostal snake-handlers, zombies, psychopaths, and assorted freaks populate these witty and gritty tales of horror by a master of the genre. The suspenseful, action-packed tales range from visions of a post-apocalyptic world (\"Tight Little Stitches in a Dead Man's Back,\" \"On the Far Side of the Cadillac Desert with Dead Folks\") to alternative histories (\"Trains Not Taken,\" \"Letter from the South, Two Moons West of Nacogdoches\"). A dozen other stories of gruesome violence and utter depravity include \"The Pit,\" in which car trouble develops into a life-or-death struggle; \"Night They Missed the Horror Show,\" involving an encounter with ornery rednecks; and \"Hell Through a Windshield,\" in which a drive-in movie provides a one-way ticket to another dimension.By Bizarre Hands, Joe R. Lansdale's debut collection of short stories, was nominated for a Bram Stoker Award for Best Fiction, and two of its tales have received Stoker awards. Lansdale's novella Bubba Ho-Tep was adapted into a 2002 film, and his Hap and Leonard detective stories inspired the Sundance Channel television series. This edition features an Introduction by science-fiction novelist Lewis Shiner and an Afterword by horror fiction author Ramsey Campbell.
