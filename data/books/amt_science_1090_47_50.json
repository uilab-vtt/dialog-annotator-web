Boyle, winner of the 2015 Rea Award for the Short StoryT. C. Boyle is one of the most inventive and wickedly funny short story writers at work today. Over the course of twenty-five years, Boyle has built up a body of short fiction that is remarkable in its range, richness, and exuberance. His stories have won accolades for their irony and black humor, for their verbal pyrotechnics, for their fascination with everything bizarre and queasy, and for the razor-sharp way in which they dissect America's obsession with image and materialism. Gathered together here are all of the stories that have appeared in his four previous collections, as well as seven that have never before appeared in book form. Together they comprise a book of small treasures, a definitive gift for Boyle fans and for every reader ready to discover the \"ferocious, delicious imagination\" (Los Angeles Times Book Review) of a \"vibrant sensibility fully engaged with American society\" (The New York Times)."}, {"id": "B077MRPMRN", "genre": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "title": "Knight and Champion", "description": "Catelyn la Berne dreams of becoming a knight, but the odds are stacked against her.
