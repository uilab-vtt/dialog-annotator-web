His childhood was a mix of hard work on his family\u2019s ranch, wild days hunting and living rough in the outdoors, and a succession of dreary, military-strict \"Indian Schools\" that sought to impose white culture on Indian children. Jim hated them and frequently ran away, but it was at one such school, in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, that his life would change. Watching some student athletes practicing the high jump, Jim asked if he might try. Wearing overalls and a work shirt, he effortlessly cleared the bar on his first attempt\u2014breaking the school\u2019s high jump record. He was drafted onto the track and football teams by the school\u2019s coach, Pop Warner, and went on to lead Carlisle to victories over the best college teams of the time. At the 1912 Stockholm Olympics, Thorpe won the five-event Pentathlon with a score that would never be beaten, and the even more grueling Decathlon with a score that stood for 20 years."}, {"id": "0316308552", "genre": "Children's Books", "title": "How Night Came from the Sea: A Story from Brazil", "description": "A beautifully illustrated retelling of a Brazilian tale linking Brazil's African heritage with a history of slavery recounts how an African goddess brings the gift of night to the hardworking people of Brazil."}, {"id": "1635175240", "genre": "Children's Books", "title": "The Debate about Playing Video Games", "description": "Provides a thorough overview of the major pros and cons of playing video games.
