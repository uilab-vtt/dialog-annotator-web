They spread out underwater, smothering sea plants and destroying fish eggs in the Mediterranean Sea. They multiply and invade wooded areas in Australia and Hawaii, killing off the native flora and fauna. They travel by air, water, boat...even on the shoes and clothes of humans!Award-winning science writer Mary Batten introduces young readers to the serious and ongoing environmental problems caused by invasive plant and animal species. Citing numerous examples, including the accidental release of the gypsy moth into the United States in 1869 and the deliberate introduction of rabbits to Australia by English settlers, Batten shows how in each case the delicate balance of the local ecosystem is threatened or even destroyed by the foreign intrusion.At the end of the book, Batten offers readers ideas they can use to minimize their own impact on local environments. Artist Beverly Doyle's realistic, full-color illustrations and maps highlight the diversity of the natural world and outline the global routes taken by animal and plant invaders."}, {"id": "0692022090", "genre": "Children's Books", "title": "A Turtle Who Likes To Eat Fish", "description": "\u201cA Turtle Who Likes To Eat Fish\u201d is a song and illustrated children's book developed from the true story of our own red eared slider.
