The higher class Helds call the lower class \"Serons\", which means \"Zeroes\" in Danadonian, their language.One day, a young Seron girl, Wolvena Nillin, decides that she should fight for her rights, and she, as well as all other plebeians, should be allowed to defend Heldic lands. Wolvena's dream is to at least once see King Daniel the Magnificent and Prince Drahtar, the king and prince of Dragharon, the kingdom of dragons. She counts them as her heroes, because Daniel was the one who ended the war between Draghars and Helds, and Drahtar ended the war between Helds and Lavadans. As the wars are over and Heldic tribe became peaceful, the girl believes that there should be made changes in their traditions too. Will Wolvena be able to achieve her goals and change Heldic life? Or will she fail?
