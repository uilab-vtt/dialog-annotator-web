This collection of quotes and mini paragraphs is an unsuspected stance of modern philosophy where it caters to an audience that has read, heard and seen it all and is in search for nuance and charisma through the lens of hopeful cynicism. It shows that the transformation of philosophy is moving towards a high density format where input explanatory volume may shrink but rate of change of input volume and the amount of shrinkage of it is equal and opposite to the increase  and expansivity in the amount and rate of interpretive volume. Hence brevity is taking charge and this books assumes that the audience is as brave, courageous and intellectual as the author. So grab that cuppa and give it a go and once you are done reading through, then bring it along to your local pub when you go down for a brief chat, hopefully that is where your fellow pub rats will learn about it leading to their much awaited illumination and the spark they have been missing in their pseudo-optimistic alcohol infused lives.

Tarizon is recovering from a series of super volcanic eruptions that nearly destroyed all life on the planet. It is slowly recovering ecologically but the political situation is volatile. The fight is between the Purists who want to rid Tarizon of a growing mutant population and eliminate all non-human intelligent life-forms, and the Loyalists who want to restore the Supreme Mandate that guarantees freedom and basic rights for all humans and other sentient beings.  Videl Lai has become Chancellor in a tainted election. Once in power, he renounces Tarizon's constitution, The Supreme Mandate, and orders the extermination of all non-human life forms. The Loyalist party anticipating Videl's rise to power, has been planning a civil war to restore rule under the Supreme Mandate and stop the genocide. But the Loyalist Party is weak and there is little hope it will be able to defeat Videl Lai and his formidable army. The only hope seems to be a prophecy that foretells of the arrival of a Liberator from Earth who would lead a revolt to rid Tarizon of a ruthless dictator.  Peter, much to his shock and dismay, soon learns that many on Tarizon believe that he is this Liberator and is expected to lead the revolution against Videl Lai and free the Nanomites, Mutants and Seafolken from bondage."}]
