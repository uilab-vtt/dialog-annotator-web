But for a girl who was orphaned and hungry, with raggedy clothes and often no place to spend the night, small change was not enough. One amateur night at Harlem's Apollo Theater, Ella made a discovery: the dancing beat in her feet could travel up and out of her mouth in a powerful song --and the feeling of being listened to was like a salve to her heart. With lively prose, Roxane Orgill follows the gutsy Ella from school-girl days to a featured spot with Chick Webb's band and all the way to her number-one radio hit \"A-Tisket, A-Tasket.\" Jazzy mixed-media art by illustrator Sean Qualls brings the singer's indomitable spirit to life.Back matter includes resources for further information, and an index."}, {"id": "0792253841", "genre": "Children's Books", "title": "National Geographic Investigates: Ancient Africa: Archaeology Unlocks the Secrets of Africa's Past", "description": "Archaeology reveals the rich histories of complex cultures in the cradle of humankind.
