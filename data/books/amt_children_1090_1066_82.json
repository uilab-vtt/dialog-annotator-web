This is a story about enchantment-how the land enchants us, how we enchant one another-why it's necessary that we do, and dangerous when we don't. Like 14 year old Jody, we learn not just the names of trees and stars and birds, but also of \"the gate between worlds,\" a place she stumbles across in a forgotten back pasture, both ordinary and powerfully mysterious. \"Quietly beautiful, *The Alphabet Stones* is magical and ethereal yet also deeply evocative of, and grounded, in place.\" -Jan Thornhill \"Ursula Pflug's writing is the kind you want to carry around with you for those days when it feels like you're living in a strange and incomprehensible world.\" -Mathew Cheney"}, {"id": "1548936200", "genre": "Children's Books", "title": "Benjamin Wanted Dead Or Alive Cash Reward $100,000,000: Western Themed Personalized Name Journal Notebook For Boys", "description": "Are you looking for personalized books with your child's name?We have the top 50 boy and top 50 girl names in the US on these unique and funny personalized journals.
