(Illustrated)", "description": "\"Romulus, first king of Rome, ruled for thirty-seven years (753-716). He found the city needed  inhabitants, and to increase their number he opened an asylum, to which many refugees fled. But wives were needed. To supply this want, he celebrated games, and invited the neighboring people, the SABINES, to attend the sports. When all were engaged in looking on, the Romans suddenly made a rush and seized the Sabine virgins. This bold robbery caused a war, which finally ended in a compromise, and a sharing of the city with the Sabines. Romulus then chose one hundred Senators, whom he called PATRES. He also divided the people into thirty wards. In the thirty-seventh year of his reign he disappeared, and was believed to have been taken up into heaven...\"An excellent survey of the history of Rome, from the legendary founding through the Republic to the Empire and the subsequent collapse of the Western Roman Empire.
