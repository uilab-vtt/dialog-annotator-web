Becky Albertalli meets The Princeton Review in this witty, nerve-racking, and occasionally heartsick look at college admissions.Mischa Abramavicius is a walking, talking, top-scoring, perfectly well-rounded college application in human form. So when she's rejected not only by the Ivies, but her loathsome safety school, she is shocked and devastated. All the sacrifices her mother made to send her to prep school, the late nights cramming for tests, the blatantly r\u00e9sum\u00e9-padding extracurriculars (read: Students for Sober Driving) ... all that for nothing. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As Mischa grapples with the prospect of an increasingly uncertain future, she questions how this could have happened in the first place. Is it possible that her transcript was hacked? With the help of her best friend and sometimes crush, Nate, and a group of eccentric techies known as \"The Ophelia Syndicate,\" Mischa launches an investigation that will shake the quiet community of Blanchard Prep to its stately brick foundations.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In her sophomore novel, A. E. Kaplan cranks the humor to full blast, and takes a serious look at the extreme pressure of college admissions."}]
