It is part of the whimsy initiated by Cherie Scott when she read Ann Videan\u2019s Song of the Ocarina fantasy novel. That first book in the Delfaerune Rhapsody series\u2014which tells the story of New Zealand Fae who use music and Earth energy to create magic\u2014inspired Cherie to craft a tiny faerie portal for Ann\u2019s birthday. As a thank you note, the author wrote an original Faerie\u2019s Tale back to her friend. After some hugs, a few tears, and a brainstorming session, the two Faerie Environmentalists originated Absolutely Wild! Enchanted Faerie Portals & Other Whimsy. The friends now joyfully handcraft coloring books, and custom faerie portals and Faeries' Tales based on information you provide. Absolutely Wild! supports emerging young writers. Ann and Cherie believe creative writing, encouraged from a young age, helps develop creative communication skills.

They are totally self-sufficient, completely certain that the death wave cannot harm them, and utterly uninterested in helping to save other civilizations, whether organic or machine. But now that the humans have discovered them, they refuse to allow them to leave their planet, reasoning that other humans will inevitably follow if they learn of their existence. "}]
