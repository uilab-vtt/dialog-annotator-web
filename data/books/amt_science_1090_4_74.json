Hope, reason, humanity: the Misery breaks them all. \u00a0 Under its cracked and wailing sky, the Misery is a vast and blighted expanse, the arcane remnant of a devastating war with the immortals known as the Deep Kings. The war ended nearly a century ago, and the enemy is kept at bay only by the existence of the Engine, a terrible weapon that protects the Misery\u2019s border. Across the corrupted no-man\u2019s-land teeming with twisted magic and malevolent wraiths, the Deep Kings and their armies bide their time. Watching. Waiting. \u00a0 Bounty hunter Ryhalt Galharrow has breathed Misery dust for twenty bitter years. When he\u2019s ordered to locate a masked noblewoman at a frontier outpost, he finds himself caught in the middle of an attack by the Deep Kings, one that signifies they may no longer fear the Engine. Only a formidable show of power from the very woman he is seeking, Lady Ezabeth Tanza, repels the assault. \u00a0 Ezabeth is a shadow from Galharrow\u2019s grim past, and together they stumble onto a web of conspiracy that threatens to end the fragile peace the Engine has provided.

Science Fiction shares the new themes - the quest of identity, the relativity of time and consciousness, the overlapping of illusion and reality - with works of modern and especially postmodern fiction. On the other hand, the innovative postmodern fiction of Pynchon, Borges, Vonnegut, and William Burroughs incorporates Science Fiction motifs, thereby blending the two genres. This book, in a series of juxtapositions and contrastive literary analyses, clarifies and questions existing genre borderlines and breaks new ground in the literary theory of postmodern fiction and of Science Fiction."}, {"id": "B077PW8CBB", "genre": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "title": "Around the World in Eighty Days", "description": "Having assured the members of London's exclusive Reform Club that he will circumnavigate the world in 80 days, Fogg - stiff, repressed, English - starts by joining forces with an irrepressible Frenchman, Passepartout, and then with a ravishing Indian beauty, Aouda. Together they slice through jungles, over snowbound passes, even across an entire isthmus - only to get back five minutes late. Fogg faces despair and suicide, but Aouda makes a new man of him, able to face even the Reform Club again.Around the World in Eighty Days (1872) contains a strong dose of post-Romantic reality plus extensive borrowing from the author's own Journey to England and Scotland - but not a shred of science fiction. Its modernism lies instead in the experimental literary technique, with parallel plots, a narrator constantly made to look foolish, four characters in search of their own unconscious, and a unique twisting of space and time."}, {"id": "1941157033", "genre": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "title": "Short Fuse", "description": "Overweight and over-the-hill, Jason Miller was on the road to nowhere.
