One day he got out and disappeared for 3 weeks. When he returned home he was dragging his hind legs. Immediately, his owner took him to the animal hospital. After many weeks the veterinarian made Prince almost as good as new, but nothing could fix his broken back. So he was paralyzed from his waist down. Prince did not see himself as any different from other cats. In his head he was exactly like before, except he now wore a diaper instead of using the litter pan. When Prince left behind his old world for the new he decided to be part of the action and the team. He gave himself jobs. He did not see himself as paralyzed. He saw himself as \"Prince, a Working Cat\". He became a teacher, nurse, helper and friend to the many, many helpless, sick, hurt and frightened animals he saw every day. This new life kept him busy."}, {"id": "1771602856", "genre": "Children's Books", "title": "West Coast ABCs", "description": "Ahoy, away we go!
