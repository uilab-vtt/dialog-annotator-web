Julia Johnson isn't like the other students at the Rosewood School. She takes a bike to school, not a BMW. She goes home every night to a run-down apartment that she shares with her mom and her cat. While the other girls obsess over the upcoming visit from some princess, Julia is trying to find the money to keep a roof over her family's heads.   Then Carina, the Crown Princess of Vineland, shows up at Rosewood for a speech, and Julia finds her answer. The thing is, Julia's a dead ringer for Carina. And when Carina offers her ten thousand dollars to switch places for one day, Julia can't say no.   But when the real princess doesn't come back from her day off, Julia finds herself on a plane to Vineland. How long before her cover gets blown? What will Carina's almost-fianc\u00e9, Markus, say when he finds out she's been lying to him? And how in the world is she going to explain all this to her mother?"}]
