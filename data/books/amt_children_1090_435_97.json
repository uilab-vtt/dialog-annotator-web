Published on the same paper-like material used in shipping envelopes, Indestructibles are 100% baby-proof: chew-proof, drool-proof, and rip-proof. That's because Indestructibles not only will not tear or turn gummy with teething, but they are also completely washable.Indestructibles are also energetic, beautiful, and created just for baby. The printing material reproduces color artwork with uncommon depth, and with no residual inkiness; the artwork, paintings by Kaaren Pixton and reminiscent of Eric Carle, is happy, each page a simple, colorful image of an animal or bird or insect against a rich, textured background. The effect is 3D-like and completely visual. There are no words, making each perfect for parents and babies to look at together, with mom or dad telling the story.Three titles launch the series: Creep! Crawl! about animals that crawl, Flutter! Fly! about animals that fly, and Wiggle! March! about farm animals\u2015books babies can really sink their teeth into."}]
