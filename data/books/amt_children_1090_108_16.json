Who was this man, and how had he come to be there? With striking photographs and engaging text, James M. Deem tells the story of Grauballe Man and other bog bodies discovered in European peat bogs.

Given its varied and enduring themes of racism, love, jealousy, betrayal, revenge and repentance, Othello is still often performed in professional and community theatre alike, and has been the source for numerous operatic, film, and literary adaptations...El personaje principal, Otelo, se presenta piadosamente, a pesar de su raza. Esto era poco habitual en la literatura inglesa en tiempos de Shakespeare, la cual presentaba como villanos a los moros y otros pueblos de piel oscura. En esta obra Shakespeare evita cualquier discusi\u00f3n respecto del islam. Otelo se ha destacado por su gran profundizaci\u00f3n en la ret\u00f3rica y la tragedia."}]
