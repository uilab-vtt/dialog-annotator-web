A Time Travel card can be played while in the Line-Up or on the Super-Villain stack at the cost of discarding a card from hand. It will give you a bonus for the turn, but then you can't buy or gain that card. Players will have interesting decisions to make each turn. If you use a Time Travel ability, it limits your purchase options, and it also means the next player will be able to use that Time Travel card as well.
