With warmth and humor, Archbishop Tutu distills his philosophy of unity and forgiveness for the very young. (Ages 1-3)Archbishop Desmond Tutu has a vision of God's dream, which he shares here with the youngest of listeners. It involves people who reach out and hold each other's hands, but sometimes get angry and hurt each other -- and say they're sorry and forgive. It's a wish that everyone will see they are brothers and sisters, no matter their way of speaking to God, no matter the size of their nose or the shade of their skin. Aided by vibrant artwork evoking such images as a rainbow and a sharing circle, Tutu offers the essence of his ubuntu philosophy, a wisdom so clear and crystalline that even the smallest child can understand."}, {"id": "1429670959", "genre": "Children's Books", "title": "Baby Sea Otter Story (Baby Animals)", "description": "Use a rock to open shells.

First, the shapes and colors featured in the books will spark the child's creative spirit and potentially generate a desire to draw similar figures. Second, the picture books featuring wild creatures will likely spark questions regarding the personal preferences and proclivities of the animals. Once these questions formulate in the child's mind, she or he will likely begin to extrapolate about the answers and/or have lively conversations with his or her parent regarding the animals."}]
