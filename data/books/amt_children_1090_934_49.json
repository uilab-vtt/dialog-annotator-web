That said, Peebles, Scotland is a wonderful little town, plucked out of a storybook, where birds fly and dogs run, and red-haired boys and girls ride bicycles and play in the green of the town and vast countryside.   Award winning author, attorney, and former teacher Penelope Dyan and professional photographer John D. Weigand invite you to embark with them on a small trip though this colorful town where they ate delicious fish and chips along the river tweed and stayed in a hotel that was a castle! This book, like all the Weigand/Dyan travel books, will not merely spoon feed kids a bunch of facts. It will encourage imagination.  See what things your children can find out about this place and make this book their own by inserting their own photographs, drawing, tickets, notes and whatever they want within these pages.  This is how a child really learns--by doing, not my memorizing sets of facts.  Children always see things very differently than adults, and Dyan and Weigand are able to see what children see and invite them to find out more!"}, {"id": "0448431807", "genre": "Children's Books", "title": "The Little Engine That Could Goes on a Class Trip (Reading Railroad Books)", "description": "The Little Engine That Could is so excited-she's going to the safari zoo with Piney Vale School's second-grade class!
