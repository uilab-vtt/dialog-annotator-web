Using materials and methods common to Montessori classrooms, these interactive board books immerse young children in an aesthetically rich learning experience, while providing parents and caregivers with carefully crafted language to encourage understanding.In Montessori classrooms, students learn to write before they learn to read, so the process is driven by their own words and thoughts before those of others. Letters are taught first as sounds (instead of names), and alphabet tiles encourage children to trace each letter with their fingers. This book honors that tradition by emulating the standard classroom material with touchable, traceable letters and beautiful colors that evoke the elegant simplicity of the Montessori aesthetic.Praise for Montessori: Letter Work\"The combination of phonetics and simple retro illustration makes for an excellent entree into pre-literacy.\"\u2014The Wall Street Journal"}, {"id": "B005Q8BM9Y", "genre": "Children's Books", "title": "Discover Science: Whales and Dolphins", "description": "Whales and Dolphins introduces readers to some of the largest and most acrobatic mammals in oceans and seas.
