What could possibly go wrong? Carl's looking forward to a quiet life with his soon-to-be wife and the child they're expecting. But when Amy makes a simple request, there's a catch. She wants their wedding on Earth so her mother can be there. For a law-abiding citizen, that would be a pricey but straightforward request. For a band of outlaws, flying into the galaxy's headquarters for law and order would be suicidal... without a plan. As usual, Carl refuses to take impossible as an option. But somewhere amid the complicated web of deception, betrayal, and lies, a key part of the plan doesn't go as expected. As Carl's house of cards collapses, there's only one thing they can do: rescue who they can, while they can. Because after that, it'll be time to disappear. Who will survive this final mission of the Mobius crew's story? Is a happy ending even possible in the Black Ocean?
