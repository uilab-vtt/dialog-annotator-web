They had no idea that their family tragedy would involve them, years later, in the crime of the century in Springfield. In a place where family values are more important than wealth or fame, it was inconceivable that a judge could be involved in the events that stunned the entire city. On a peaceful September day, a family law judge is missing. The daring attack was carried out by a secret society devoted to protecting the public from injustices committed by the leaders in the community. The investigation by the local authorities was struggling until someone, quite unexpectedly, steps up to assist them in their search. In a most unusual way, this crime is turned into a story of faith and redemption that no one thought was possible. Washington Park is a story about how we can overcome the challenges we face. With God's help, great things can be accomplished in our lives when we least expect it."}]
