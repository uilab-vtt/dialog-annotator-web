And like a new day, each horizon is original. Sun, clouds, sky, water, even skyscrapers shape the distance and offer us new views and the chance to think about what lies beyond. Renowned poet and author Jane Yolen gives us her insights on horizons great and small in fourteen new poems. Inspired by Jason Stemple's stunning photographs of vistas found in deserts, swamps, mountains, and other scenic places, Ms. Yolen, in thoughtful, playful verse, allows us to imagine what happens when earth meets sky."}]
