Here is a wolf that is protector and helper to his little forest friends, bringing them light to banish the darkness, joy to counter their sadness, even contemplating the sunset with his arm around his friend the sheep. A short history of St. Francis and of the prayer is included to help readers put it in perspective.Children will be drawn into the warm, whimsical, and charming illustrations that truly make the prayer come alive. And as they read it to and with children, adults will find themselves smiling at and contemplating this book that will remind them of the beauty and simplicity of this prayer."}, {"id": "1974191885", "genre": "Children's Books", "title": "Positive Thinking Positive Outcome: Back To School Composition Notebook, 8.5 x 11 Large, 120 Pages College Ruled (Back To School Journal)", "description": "Cute & Cool Composition College Ruled NotebooksThis awesome school journal for kids and college students has 120 lined pages measuring 8.5 x 11 with a matte cover people will be jealous of.
