How can they hope to escape their stalker when he can become anything or anyone he desires and where does the pursuit of revenge stop for immortals in an eternal world?\"One of the finest novels of virtual reality yet written... a novel that combines elements of love story, thriller, and work of ideas, yet gains its impact from being more than the sum of these. And it all works. It works brilliantly. In The Accord, Keith Brooke has created a dazzling work of the imagination.\" SF Site \"The emotion-driven love triangle neatly complements the tech- and philosophy-heavy nature of the Accord, making this rumination on posthumous, posthuman love a rare treat.\" Publishers Weekly 5* review  \"Brooke's fifth science-fiction novel is an intelligent examination of the technological possibilities of VR and a brilliant dissection of how individuals and society will change when freed from material bounds. The Accord is not only Brooke's best novel to date, but one of the finest to broach the subject of virtual reality.\" The Guardian \"A truly major sf work that should be considered for all eligible awards.\" SFF World  \"Keith Brooke's take on posthumanism is one of the best approaches of the subject I've ever seen.\" SF Signal"}, {"id": "075641119X", "genre": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "title": "The Complete Arrows Trilogy", "description": "Available in a single volume for the first time, Mercedes Lackey\u2019s debut trilogy of Valdemar! \u00a0 The Complete Arrows Trilogy contains the three extraordinary novels that launched Mercedes Lackey\u2019s remarkable career and sparked the imaginations of millions of readers across the world. \u00a0 The Arrows trilogy tells the story of Talia, a daughter of the repres\u00adsive Holderfolk, who is Chosen by the immortal Companion Rolan to become one of the legendary Heralds of Valdemar.  \u00a0 Companions like Rolan are mystical horse-like beings with powers beyond imagining\u2014including the power to sense an awakening potential for special talents of the mind in certain young men and women, like Talia.  \u00a0 With Rolan\u2019s help, Talia will learn to master her unique mental abilities of telepathy and empathy, and will grow from an uncertain and inexperienced Herald trainee to become the most important Herald of all: the Queen\u2019s Own.  \u00a0 And together, Talia and Rolan will fight to protect the queen, the heir to the throne, and the entire kingdom\u2014from dangerous conspiracies, looming unrest, vicious treachery, and even an evil and ancient sorcery beyond the magic of the Heralds themselves."}, {"id": "1934857807", "genre": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "title": "Historical Operation Klondike (Battletech Sourcebooks)", "description": "This book is SOFTCOVER, not hardcover as indicated!
