Here lived 2-year-old Lhamo Dhondrub, who would go on to become the 14th Dalai Lama. But how did this toddler grow into one of the world's most important religious figures? And why has he been forced into exile?The Dalai Lama looks at his extraordinary story, from his education by monks, deep in the Tibetan mountains, to how he became leader of Tibet aged just 15. The Chinese invasion of Tibet, that forced him to flee his homeland, and begin a new life and government in exile in India, is explained, as is the plight of ordinary Tibetans. The Buddhist faith, and exactly what it means to be a Buddhist, is explored, as is the role it plays in the lives of people around the world. The book also looks at the Dalai Lama's work as a teacher and a leader, and at some of the issues he campaigns for - particularly his environmental activism, and his work to promote religious cooperation and interfaith dialogue."}]
