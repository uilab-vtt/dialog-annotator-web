This family are the guardians who protect it from the evil enveloping our world, casting Theodoros' life into mayhem. Following each of his descendants and the danger often accompanying the device, this is a spiritual quest, exposing how religion has often cloaked the truth from mankind, with risk of death to the keepers of truth - those heretics who speak up against an organization claiming to be God's mouthpiece and ultimate authority. The spiritual conflict spans centuries, illustrating the nature of religious worship, from ancient times into the modern. No matter how much things change, they remain the same. Set in ancient Greece on the island of Antikythera, this is vivid, surreal, and a smorgasbord of antiquated ritual. Metaphysical historical fantasy has found a true home in this novel. Angels walk with men, the realm of gods has no boundary, and religious family feuds are the most misguided toxin of all. This is a profound tale which delivers a journey worthy of the saints."}, {"id": "B0786QGKXH", "genre": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "title": "World Above (The Three Cities Series Book 1)", "description": "Put simply, young Russel Remington is satisfied.
