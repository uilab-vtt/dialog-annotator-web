In this story, an expanded version of Collodi's original tale, we see him lose his tail to an ancient crocodile, end up as a valet to a young master, fall into the hands of flying bandits and become emperor of a tribe of apes.Collodi wrote this story immediately after Pinocchio, and the little monkey's adventures present clear similarities, both in terms of themes and characters, with his more celebrated masterpiece. This rediscovered gem of Italian literature, beautifully illustrated by Axel Scheffler and preserving all of Collodi's trademark wit and linguistic crispness, will delight and enthral a new generation of children."}, {"id": "1442473320", "genre": "Children's Books", "title": "U.S. Presidents (Ken Jennings\u2019 Junior Genius Guides)", "description": "Become a presidential pro with this interactive trivia book from Jeopardy! champ and New York Times bestselling author Ken Jennings.With this book about U.S. Presidents, you\u2019ll become an expert and wow your friends and teachers with clever facts: Did you know that Abraham Lincoln made Thanksgiving a national holiday?
