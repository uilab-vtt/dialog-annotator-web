But when state trooper Laura Caxton calls the FBI looking  for help in the middle of the night, Arkeley is unsurprised to hear that it sounds like a vampire attack. He\u2019s been expecting such a call to come eventually. Sure, it has been years since  any signs of an attack, but Arkeley knows what most people don\u2019t: there is one left. In an abandoned asylum she is rotting, plotting, and biding her time in a way that  only the undead can. Laura Caxton is out of her league on this case and more than a little  afraid. Arkeley made it clear there is only one way out. The worst thing  is the feeling that the vampires want more than just her blood. They want her for  a reason, one she can\u2019t guess; a reason her sphinxlike partner knows but won\u2019t say;  a reason she has to find out-or die trying.From the Trade Paperback edition."}, {"id": "160125587X", "genre": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "title": "Pathfinder Adventure Path: Wrath of the Righteous Part 6 - City of Locusts", "description": "\u2014 The heroes of the Fifth Crusade have risen to undreamed of heights of power and have dealt blow after blow to the demonic armies of the Worldwound.
