Some live under bridges, others deep inside caves. They can carry their heads under their arms or hide their hearts inside wells. They can walk across oceans and fly over mountains. Trees and shrubs may grow from their heads, and their noses can be long enough to stir soup. There are troll hags, troll daughters, and elderly, shrunken trolls. Old or young, they are quarrelsome, ugly, and boastful, and they love to trick princesses and children. To defeat them, children must rely on the strengths of their humanity-persistence, kindness, pluck, and willingness to heed good advice"}, {"id": "B00QM6YPBG", "genre": "Children's Books", "title": "Algonquin Spring: An Algonquin Quest Novel (An Algonguin Quest Novel)", "description": "Six years ago, Mahingan\u2019s wife was taken from him by the Haudenosaunee at the Battle of the Falls.
