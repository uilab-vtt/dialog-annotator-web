They say that night would follow day in an endless dance.  They say that dawn rose, dusk fell, and we worshiped both sun and stars.That was a long time ago.The dance has died.  The world has fallen still. We float through the heavens, one half always in light, one half always in shadow.  Like the moth of our forests, one wing white and the other black, we are torn.My people are the fortunate.  We live in daylight, blessed in the warmth of the sun.  Yet across the line, the others lurk in eternal night, afraid... and alone in the dark.I was born in the light.  I was sent into darkness.  This is my story."}, {"id": "B0733Y5RXX", "genre": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "title": "2Dee (My Name is Dee)", "description": "The population of Los Angeles has vanished. John Dee has to find out why. With the help of his AI son, he journeys between dimensions, undergoes radical body modifications, topples extrasolar governments, and hunts his lost love, all without a clear idea of who he is. To rescue his city, and himself, he must confront both the cruelty of the universe he finds himself in, and his own interior darkness. - - \"Weird, avant-garde, poetic and challenging. Robin Dunn's 2DEE fairly bubbles, a surreal experiment that looks and smells like SF. But it's really a fever dream of ghetto genres, broken cliches and ultimately an elegy to the sprawl of urban LA. At first, I wanted more aliens, but everything about this is alien. Arrogant, neurotic, playful, it reads like an SF hallucination, a satire, the last thoughts of a dying man, fragments leading up to the apocalypse. 2DEE is an heir to the 1970's New Wave science fiction movement.\"        -- Roger Leatherwood, author of Naked in Hollywood"}, {"id": "1626948275", "genre": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "title": "Goodwill", "description": "Two Weeks before Christmas\u2026 Finding a red weave pocketbook, containing a passport bathed in a creepy glowing plasma, in a Goodwill and being followed around by the murdered woman to whom it belonged is just another day in the life of Theresa Lillian Lewis.
