Trees produce the oxygen animals need to live. They also provide homes for animals and resources for people. However, Earth's forests are under attack. Deforestation is caused by fires, clear cutting, logging, and climate change. Forests are important to mitigating climate change because they suck up harmful carbon dioxide. Without forests, many plant and animal species would be at risk of becoming endangered or extinct. Complete with manageable text and stunning photographs of forests, both healthy and threatened, this book covers essential concepts featured in elementary earth science curricula."}]
