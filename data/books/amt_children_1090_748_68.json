In its 1,885-mile course to the sea and in the history that has unfolded on its banks, it is also one of North America's most dramatic rivers. Peter Lourie explores the Rio Grande to discover what makes the \"Great River\" great. He follows it from its headwaters in Colorado's snow-capped Rockies to the Gulf of Mexico's sub-tropical shores. His journey takes him into the territories of Billy the Kid and Pancho Villa. He visits an ancient Pueblo where he witnesses an annual feast day and corn dance. When the river becomes a 1,000-mile boarder between Mexico and the United States, he accompanies the U.S. Border Patrol, then takes a whitewater rafting trip through desert canyons of Big Bend National Park. Finally, the author's journey ends with a dive into the warm waters of the Gulf. Here is the Rio Gande of history and legend, vividly brought to life through a lively and informative text, illustrated with full-color and archival photographs."}]
