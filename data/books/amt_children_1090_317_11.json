She is fearless and resourceful. Undaunted by a frustrating night on a tiny desert island, she captains her little sloop successfully back home to a happy surprise. Written in clever, well-crafted, natural verse and profusely illustrated with delightful pictures, this is definitely a read-aloud book. It\u2019s a real charmer for any young child. The author avoids the impoverished vocabulary so commonly seen in children\u2019s books. The young reader will learn a few new words (and maybe just a pinch about sailing). The voyage through Sailor Marie's thirty-six pages takes less than fifteen minutes\u0097a nice length for a bed-time story. It\u2019s recommended for ages five to eight (but it\u2019s not illegal to read it to any adult sweet-heart who retains a fondness for those really good children\u2019s books)."}, {"id": "B072C91CWY", "genre": "Children's Books", "title": "Treasure Island", "description": "When young Jim Hawkins discovers a mysterious map in a dead man's sea-chest, he sets off on a thrilling adventure of pirates, treasure, and villainy.
