This book contains the recipe for a mug eggs with a Mexican twist. The recipe is presented in both an easy, photo-enhanced version and a more standard version, which usually contains decorating ideas and possible substitutions. My intent with this series is to have a format that new readers or people who have difficulty reading can follow because of related photographs and simple language, as well as a version for people who don't. In addition, Text-to-Speech is available for those units that can use it. People who are learning English or who have disabilities limiting their reading may enjoy this title, as well as young English-speaking children. A mom uses this series with her middle school daughter, a new cook, and adults use the recipes for food they can make very quickly. These titles might also come in handy for bad weather days because I've tried to stay away from strange, expensive, or hard-to-find ingredients."}, {"id": "9962690404", "genre": "Children's Books", "title": "Jake's Best Birthday EVER! * \u00a1El MEJOR cumplea\u00f1os de Jake!", "description": "Go on tour with Grandma Terry as she decides what parts of the BIG APPLE she will give to Jake for his birthday.
