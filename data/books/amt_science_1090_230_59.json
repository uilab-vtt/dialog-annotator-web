Currently on display in the museum is a set of rocks found at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. These geologically unique stones are believed to be of lunar origin, ejected from the moon by the impact of a meteorite. The rocks have been on display in the Smithsonian in Washington, D.C. until recently, but they are now part of a traveling exhibit touring the country. They are on the final leg of the tour, with San Diego as the last stop before being returned to the Smithsonian, and will remain in the city for the next two weeks.  A new comet nears the inner solar system for the first time in recorded history. Comet Negretto, discovered by and named after Italian astronomer Sylvio Negretto, is moving increasingly closer to our planet as it follows its elongated path around the sun, growing more prominent in the skies as it approaches. Because of its current location in the heavens, it appears only at night\u2014and, because of its distance, only on clear evenings. As it nears and crosses Earth\u2019s orbit our planet will pass through the comet's tail, just as it did with Halley's Comet earlier in the century. Astronomers and other scientists assure the public that no harm will be done, as the gasses are so diverse that no one would ever know of the event if the public hadn\u2019t been alerted ahead of time. How are these circumstances related, and what have they to do with our intrepid investigators?"}, {"id": "B0066B2WOO", "genre": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "title": "Touchstone (2.

We look at the typical components used in arcane spells and outline the key principles on which they work. An exhaustive treatment of the standard arcane spells is then provided which will inject new life and creativity into spellcasting. By daring to challenge the wisdom of the ages and use their own home-brewed recipes rather than keeping slavishly to the old ones, players may gain hitherto inaccessible levels of spell potency. Beware, however, for there is a price; he who presumes to tamper with magic must be very sure of himself, or he will cause an imbalance in the arcane forces and he will be the first to suffer for it. Even the slightest error can cause a side effect. While some of these are relatively harmless, others can cause disfigurement, crippling injury or even death. To the courageous mages who are willing to read on, this is a risk well worth taking."}]
