It's Super Hero Day. Jonesy the Chinese puppy dragon and Lamby Lambpants both have hero names and costumes for a fun, imagination-filled day with babysitter Katie Beagle. Even she has a pair of snazzy hero goggles (to hide her true identity, of course). Lamby's best friend Snout has a cape and mask too, but he doesn't have a hero name yet. Having been very recently brought to life, the anxious toy pig doesn't feel super at all. He's still shy and quite embarrassed about his missing ear and broken tail. But after a wild ride on an out-of-control toy helicopter, Snout discovers there's more to him than he ever thought. This beautifully illustrated, fun-to-read out loud picture book is for early readers."}, {"id": "1510736174", "genre": "Children's Books", "title": "Dad Can Do Anything", "description": "It\u2019s not easy being small.
