Fenton loved swinging through the jungle with Tarzan. As an adult his interest was revived when he bought Tarzan creator Edgar Rice Burroughs' original office-estate in Tarzana, California, and began writing a book about Burroughs. That 1967 work, originally titled The Big Swingers, in effect a biography both of ERB and of Tarzan, was the first full-scale, commercially published account of Burroughs' life and work.Fenton's biography is now back in print as a wonderful source for a new generation of readers: letters, documents, synopses, lists of characters, and plots and themes that Burroughs used. The book also reveals ERB's ready observations on such issues as women's suffrage, prohibition, morality in Hollywood, and the Scopes trial in Tennessee.A new foreword by George T.

Under smoking towers, the citizen workers stride among machinery built upon stolen Mostali secrets and enhanced by the vision of God Learner magicians and engineers. Through the streets, a giant automaton, the avatar of Zistor, strides proudly through the city named for him. In underground surgeries, God Learners replace their weak mortal flesh with alchemically-treated mechamagical implants, rising from blood-stained tables bearing metal limbs powered by sorcery and clockwork joints. This is the Machine City, known as the Clanking City for the noise its thousand engines make, and it stands defiant against a great siege mounted by the Empire of Wyrm's Friends and their allies of convenience. The Clanking City allows Games Masters and players to walk the streets of this infamous city in its golden age, shaping their own plots and campaigns in the towering structures and dark smoke-clogged alleys of this magical-technological nightmare metropolis."}, {"id": "1589944801", "genre": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "title": "Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay: Career Compendium", "description": "Heroes rise from all walks of life in Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay.
