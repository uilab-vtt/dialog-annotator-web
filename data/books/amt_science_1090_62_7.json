With his customary wit and intellectual sophistication, Huxley pursues his characters in their quest for the eternal, finishing on a note of horror. \"This is Mr. Huxley's Hollywood novel, and you might expect it to be fantastic, extravagant, crazy and preposterous. It is all that, and heaven and hell too....It is the kind of novel that he is particularly the master of, where the most extraordinary and fortuitous events are followed by contemplative little essays on the meaning of life....The story is outrageously good.\"\u2015New York Times. \"A highly sensational plot that will keep astonishing you to practically the final sentence.\"\u2015The New Yorker. \"Mr. Huxley's elegant mockery, his cruel aptness of phrase, the revelations and the ingenious surprises he springs on the reader are those of a master craftsman; Mr. Huxley is at the top of his form.\" \u2015London Times Literary Supplement."}, {"id": "1941110614", "genre": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "title": "Downdrift: A Novel", "description": "Narrated by an Archaean, a 3.8 billion year old species, the oldest on earth, Downdrift is a work of speculative eco-fiction that describes the impact of ecological pressures on animals that are adopting human behaviors, with droll and sometimes alarming, results. The book follows a year of changes and the travels of a housecat and a lion who are inexplicably driven towards a rendezvous. At first, a few isolated harbingers of change appear, but they quickly escalate. Squirrels take up manic knitting, wild hares steal earth-moving equipment, rats go in for disco music and form-fitting metallic leisure-ware. Data-sorting abilities appear among urban populations of birds, and frenzied domestic pets seek celebrity careers. Droll, melancholic, and poetic, the tale is crammed with witty vignettes and poignant reflections on the ways the pressures on the once-natural world are accelerating mutations in behaviors among the animals. Genetic material alters. The differences between animals blur. Odd mutant forms appear\u2013goat-chicks and dog-flies, fish-birds and flying lizards\u2013as if some mad rush is propelling genetic code to propagate across every form of flesh and living matter. As large-scale infrastructure projects make their appearance, each of the animals takes the role appropriate to its disposition\u2015or not. Melancholic rather than apocalyptic, the book is a celebration of species as well as a mourning of the damage done in our time. Throughout, the emergent voice and character of the Archaean extremophile records events as well as a slow coming to consciousness about its own identity as a hyper-organism."}, {"id": "1944946144", "genre": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "title": "Lab 42: Feenix Rising (Bug Hunters in Space) (Volume 3)", "description": " Preppers, Colonists, and the voracious Feenix Bug which one doesn\u2019t belong?
