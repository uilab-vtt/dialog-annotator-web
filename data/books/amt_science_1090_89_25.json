The book places Orwell in historical context, examining his response to Imperialism, mass unemployment in the 1930s, the revolution in Spain, as well as the Second World War and its aftermath. Particular attention is paid to Orwell's American connection, to his writings for Partisan Review and for Politics. In addition, the book looks at recent feminist critiques of Orwell's politics. Orwell's belief that Russia had nothing in common with socialism is discussed, and new sources for 1984 are identified. While his political beliefs inevitably changed over the years, he remained both an anti-Stalinist and a committed socialist up to the time of his death."}, {"id": "089879692X", "genre": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "title": "Science Fiction Writer's Marketplace and Sourcebook", "description": "Combining how-to-write instruction with where-to-sell direction, this comprehensive guide is invaluable for science fiction and fantasy writers.
