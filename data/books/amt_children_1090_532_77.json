The most daring abolitionists were poets who veiled their work in metaphor. Of these, the boldest was Gertrudis G\u00f3mez de Avellaneda, nicknamed Tula. In passionate, accessible verses of her own, Engle evokes the voice of this book-loving feminist and abolitionist who bravely resisted an arranged marriage at the age of fourteen, and\u00a0was ultimately courageous enough to fight against injustice. Historical notes, excerpts, and source notes round out this exceptional tribute."}]
