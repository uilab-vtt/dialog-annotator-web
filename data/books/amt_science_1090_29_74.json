Stories that peer sidelong at fairy tales, urban myths, history and pop culture, alongside poetry that leads convention in a quickstep around the room, then steals its wallet. You'll find Devils and princesses who don't want your sympathy, but who demand your understanding. You'll address the perils of parenting, whether you're a vampire or a rock star.  You'll meet folks who trade in books, in secrets, in navigational coordinates, and in monsters. You'll witness the consequences of leaving some doors shut too long, and the cost of opening others at all."}, {"id": "178535826X", "genre": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "title": "Methods Devour Themselves: A Conversation", "description": "Methods Devour Themselves is a dialogue between fiction and non-fiction.
