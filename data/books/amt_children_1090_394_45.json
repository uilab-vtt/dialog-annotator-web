Move the red steam engine out of the depot and to the front of the book, where the sun is just coming up over a bay, and then take a journey across wide plains, up mountains and down hills, into a city at night with its beacons of light\u2014and finally, back to the rail yard.

This uplifting story follows the first ice skating lesson of a young girl with her coach. After Kayla's first timid steps onto the ice, not only does she get to howl like a wolf and stomp on the ice but she learns that falling is the most important lesson of learning to skate. Written by a former competitive ice skater and coach, the technical aspects of the book give the story a duality -- that of a \"how to\" piece as well as a beautiful picture book. The reading level is intended for ages 3-8 but appeals to \"skaters\" of all ages."}]
