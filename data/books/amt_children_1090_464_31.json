In Egypt the sun is warm\" From his high vantage point, the glittering statue of the Happy Prince is the pride of city officials. But the Prince\u2019s sapphire eyes are filled with tears because of the suffering he sees below. Stuck fast on his pedestal, there is nothing the gem-encrusted statue can do to help relieve the poor, until a little swallow stops to rest at his feet. The Prince persuades the bird to be his messenger, and to pluck out and carry one precious jewel after another to those in need. In order to survive the winter, the swallow must fly to a warmer place, but his love for the now-shabby Prince compels him to stay despite the consequences. Time after time, the brave little bird does all that is asked, until both he and the Happy Prince have nothing left to give. Oscar Wilde\u2019s classic fairy tale of compassion and selflessness is given new life by Robin Muller\u2019s exquisite illustrations in this special edition."}]
