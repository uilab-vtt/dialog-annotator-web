But, how could he not try? \"Law Martial\"...  even the name sounded wrong.  Something drummed up by the media to explain Marines without boundaries, no laws holding them back, and only their consciences stopping them from going too far. Sam never had any intention of becoming a soldier, but when these enormous golden domes appeared on every continent, what was he to do? With half of North America encased in a Dome his natural instinct was to help those in need,  to stop the inhuman creatures streaming from the Domes, and to keep the human monsters from taking advantage of a world on the cusp of collapse. Renny, however, never signed up for anything so noble. In fact, she never signed up. She was  just a girl, one who knew right from wrong. Granted, she might be a little impulsive and makes for the worst kind of soldier. But together, she and Sam fight to keep the world from falling. They fight to save their home. They fight to make people's daily lives seem just as mundane and normal as before the Domes ever arrived. But, their story is far from mundane. What they'll learn of the Domes and the wonders inside will become a thing of legends. This is their story - The story of the Martials and The Golden Kingdom - A story which will impact the world for all of time. This is the\u00a0Second Edition printing of \"The Golden Kingdom: Z\" with new editorial content as well as new cover and interior artwork.\u00a0 All for a new low price."}, {"id": "0520284925", "genre": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "title": "Dangerous Games: What the Moral Panic over Role-Playing Games Says about Play, Religion, and Imagined Worlds", "description": " The 1980s saw the peak of a moral panic over fantasy role-playing games such as Dungeons and Dragons. A coalition of moral entrepreneurs that included representatives from the Christian Right, the field of psychology, and law enforcement claimed that these games were not only psychologically dangerous but an occult religion masquerading as a game. Dangerous Games explores both the history and the sociological significance of this panic. Fantasy role-playing games do share several functions in common with religion. However, religion\u0097as a socially constructed world of shared meaning\u0097can also be compared to a fantasy role-playing game. In fact, the claims of the moral entrepreneurs, in which they presented themselves as heroes battling a dark conspiracy, often resembled the very games of imagination they condemned as evil. By attacking the imagination, they preserved the taken-for-granted status of their own socially constructed reality. Interpreted in this way, the panic over fantasy-role playing games yields new insights about how humans play and together construct and maintain meaningful worlds. Laycock\u2019s clear and accessible writing ensures that Dangerous Games will be required reading for those with an interest in religion, popular culture, and social behavior, both in the classroom and beyond."}]
