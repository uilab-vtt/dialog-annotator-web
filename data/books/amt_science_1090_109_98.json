It does not stop to consider the lives it destroys; does not feel the pain it inflicts; nor hesitates where it devours. Its appetite is destruction, and its darkness infects wherever it wounds. It prowls through night and day, seeking the weak, the innocent, and the pure. Where it finds beauty, it mars; where it sees life, it poisons; and where there is light, darkness will fall. Charlotte Benson is no stranger to the evils of men. Plagued by terrible dreams of her past, she seeks respite in the Ouachita Mountains, at a peaceful wildlife refuge called Willow's Bend in far eastern Oklahoma. Even though she's tucked away in her tiny cabin, she knows she'll have to face her demons. But what she doesn't expect is that Willow's Bend might have its own demons that could threaten her life. When locals in Willow's Bend start talking about the strange behavior of their dogs and news surfaces about experiments in the woods, rumors run wild in the tiny community. And as Charlotte's dreams suddenly change from events in her past to those in the future-with some of the dreams even coming true-the serene mountain sanctuary she sought turns into a waking nightmare. With a unique blend of edge-of-your-seat suspense and coming-of-age narrative, Natasha Wittman reveals not only the darkness of men's hearts but the triumph of forgiveness and grace over grief in her debut novel, Wolves and Men."}]
