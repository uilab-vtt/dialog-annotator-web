The author believes that a subsequent reading of these books can take on new and inspirational meanings when the seven traditional Christian Virtues (Faith, Hope, Charity, Fortitude, Justice, Temperance and Prudence) are looked for in the stories. Each of the seven books in each series can be imagined as promoting one of the virtues as a primary theme of that book. The virtues (and their opposing vices) are seen to affect the actions of the characters, and their consequences in the stories. In the case of Harry, he can be seen as learning and absorbing one of the virtues in each story starting with Charity in the first book and ending with Prudence in the seventh book. His personal development over the seven years of his struggle against evil earns him the wisdom and skills to defeat Lord Voldemort."}, {"id": "1500828971", "genre": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "title": "1: Every One Fight (Threads of Canor) (Volume 1)", "description": "What becomes of a tough talkin' All Star Runner when she loses all pride and her beloved father?
