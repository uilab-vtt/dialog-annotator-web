(Stories from the Australian Great Barrier Reef)", "description": "Petey is a grumpy pelican who blames everyone else for his lack of friends. He has poor social skills and almost no emotional intelligence but of course, this is everyone else\u2019s problem. Petey is a member of a thriving and diverse community of birds, crabs and fish but he is always looking out for himself and is greedy and deceptive about how he sneaks food. Petey\u2019s self-centred view of the world is overlooked by his community and he is included in all their activities. However, when the community decides to protect the baby turtle hatchlings, Petey is caught in a dilemma as he doesn\u2019t want to give up his favourite snack food, so he only pretends to help. Seamore and Sasha know this and gently help him learn about sharing and telling the truth. This is a story about redemption and the reestablishment of self-worth because of the help of a supportive community."}, {"id": "B01A2YIZ0U", "genre": "Children's Books", "title": "World's Favorite Pets: Pets in Every Home: Pet Books for Kids (Children's Pet Books)", "description": "When your child wants a pet, the first thing you need to do is to introduce the concept properly.
