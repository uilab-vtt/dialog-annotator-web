As the apocalypse approaches, Stanley seeks out the rest of the world to discover the year of the rabbit.     Angry tirades, polemics and prescient conspiracy speculation fuel the novel. In the aftermath of the apocalypse, Stanley relocates to a century farm house. Enduring years of solitude and reflection, Stanley seeks human company.
