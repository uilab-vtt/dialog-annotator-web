Each fable is a meditation on love, death, growth, pain, identity, self, spirit, and the natural world, as seen from the perspectives of the primal, the celestial, or the spiritual. Fragile yet beautifully strong, Lost Cantos of the Ouroboros Caves is for anyone seeking stories for a larger life.

The realm of Tramlin has endured the disappearance of the beloved Lady Margot, daughter of the Regent Galen, the banishment of the scorned Prince Helden, heir apparent of the realm, and the flight of half of its populace under the spell of the Prodigy Lucian, an ingenious, deceptive populist, who has escaped without a trace. As neighboring realms contemplate the plunder of Tramlin, and yet more ominous tidings come to light, the fate of the realm is now in the hands of the Order of Right, four young and diverse heroes of extraordinary skill and character. There is Raelic the True, our narrator and the scholarly heir to the vaunted station of his late father, Eomond, as Steward of the Temple and the Tower. There is Devon the Just, a soldier and prince of his lost tribe in the land of Tenegalan. There is Shondra the Wise, the shaman of Devon's tribe, and his betrothed. At last, there is Nicky the Good, a scout of some renown, for her legendary nimble feats in Brighthold.  Throughout the tale, our friends in the Order learn about themselves and each other, as they grow together as harmonious in their hearts as they are in their music, while they explore the world beyond Brighthold along with their shared values and beliefs, in the natural rights and benign yearnings for security, independence, family and legacy.  Only the Maker knows where their fate and their faith will lead them."}, {"id": "1541418174", "genre": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "title": "All the Windwracked Stars (Edda of Burdens)", "description": "From the author of The Stone in the Skull It all began with Ragnarok, with the Children of the Light and the Tarnished ones battling to the death in the ice and the dark.
