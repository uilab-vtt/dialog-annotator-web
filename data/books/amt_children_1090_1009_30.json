While the two were riding in the car he asked her to tell him about heaven.  Dana quickly pulled the car over and wrote a little poem God put in her heart.  Marshall was not only satisfied with the rhyming response but it became his most cherished bedtime ritual for months.  It wasn\u2019t until years later that longtime family friend Michelle Morse brought the words to life through vivid illustrations.  By bringing this inspired book to print, the author prays heaven would become a very real place to children.
