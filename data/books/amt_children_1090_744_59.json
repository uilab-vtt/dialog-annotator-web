Large meat-eaters hunted plant-eating hadrosaurs. Ostrichlike dinosaurs darted after small prey, and armor-covered nodosaurs rambled through underbrush 75 million years ago. Giant reptiles that were not dinosaurs also lived in the South. The crocodile-like Deinosuchus, which grew to lengths near 40 feet, lurked along riverbanks. These giants probably ate dinosaurs! Pterosaurs, or flying reptiles, soared over the coast. One of the largest, Pteranodon, had a wingspan of 24 feet. Paleontologists have even identified some entirely new dinosaur species known only in the South."}, {"id": "1631138642", "genre": "Children's Books", "title": "Ah\u00ed viene el lobo gris / Here Comes the Gray Wolf (Spanish Edition) (Animales de America/ Animals of the Americas)", "description": "Wolves are strong, fierce, and cunning, but they are also playful and affectionate.

Why would a fourteen-year-old girl take on such a challenge? For Annaleise Carr, the motivation did not come from a desire for glory. Her ultimate goal was to raise money for her new friends at Camp Trillium, a charity that provides a camping experience for kids with cancer. What kept her going through the cold water, the exhaustion and the terrifying night swim was the thought of those kids and their families that she was helping. In August 2012, she became the youngest person to cross Lake Ontario. Readers will meet an extraordinary fourteen-year-old girl in this book. As she tells her story, it becomes clear how idealism and an intense desire to help others can lead a young teen to almost unimaginable achievements."}]
