Although the house he lived in is long gone, he is drawn to the farm at the end of the road, where, when he was seven, he encountered a most remarkable girl, Lettie Hempstock, and her mother and grandmother. He hasn\u2019t thought of Lettie in decades, and yet as he sits by the pond (a pond that she\u2019d claimed was an ocean) behind the ramshackle old farmhouse where she once lived, the unremembered past comes flooding back.
