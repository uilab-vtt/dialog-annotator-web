It was a match made in heaven...or so it seemed. Now Aurora has found out that she is the Harbinger and must track down the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse before leading them into the Final Battle against the Ordained--a man who wants to bring the world to its knees. In order for her to be properly trained in the art of war, the Creator has sent one of his best Battle Angels to assist her, Michaelo. He is charming, elusive and doesn't put up with any crap, which Aurora finds irresistible. After he turned her into Nephilim through the exchange of blood, she's finding it harder to stay away. If she wants to prevail, she must not only distance herself from the Angel but keep him close enough to complete her goals. That should be easy enough, right?

What accounts for its persistence? How has the story changed over the course of the twentieth century? In this provocative book, Stockton investigates the manner in which the female body\u2014or to be more precise, the violation of the female body\u2014serves as a metaphor for a complex synthesis of masculinity and political economy. From high modernism to cyberpunk, Pound to Pynchon, Stockton argues that the compulsive return to the rape story, articulates\u2014among other things\u2014the gradual and relentless removal of Western man from the fantastical capitalist role of venturesome, industrious agency. The metamorphosis of the twentieth-century rape narrative registers a desperate attempt to preserve traditional patterns of robust, entrepreneurial masculinity in the face of economic forms that increasingly disallow illusions of individual authority.   It is important to make clear that the genre of rape story studied here presumes a white masculine subject and a white feminine object. Stockton makes the case that the aestheticized rape narrative reveals particular things about the way white masculinity represents itself. Plotting violent sexual fantasy on the grid of economic concerns locates masculine agency in relation to an explicitly contingent material system of power, value, and order. It is in this way that The Economics of Fantasy discloses the increased desperation with which the body has been made to carry ideology under systems of advanced capitalism."}, {"id": "B00SWPJF9C", "genre": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "title": "Highland Wolf Clan Series, Book 1, The Reluctant Alpha: A gripping tale of Shifters full of suspense, action and paranormal romance", "description": "Born to be Alpha, Cameron Sinclair walks away from his birthright and Pack.
