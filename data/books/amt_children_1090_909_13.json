Realizing that nobody else can see the beasts who have haunted her since childhood, she embarks on a quest that takes her far from her family and castle to conquer them herself.  A story of courage and recovery that touches on mental illness, trauma, addiction and co-dependence and explains the process of a 12-step recovery in terms that children can understand.  The author--herself an alcoholic who has suffered childhood trauma--wrote the story initially for the sake of explaining these challenges to her own children.  She now hopes that other children will benefit from the story by fostering a family dialogue about recovery, addiction and the pursuit of stronger mental health. A portion of the proceeds from the sale of this book will be donated to an addiction recovery scholarship fund."}, {"id": "0595175554", "genre": "Children's Books", "title": "2 Picture Books by Carol Fenner: Tigers in the Cellar and Gorilla Gorilla", "description": "Tiger, Tiger A quiet, well-conceived picture book.Publishers Weekly Warm and deliciously suspenseful and scary.Booklist A poetic, completely harmonious and beautiful picture book.HornbookGorilla Gorilla1973 Christopher Medal for non-fiction; Library of Congress Book of the Year; ALA Notable Book; Outstanding Science Trade Book for Children.
