The idea is presented in both an easy, photo-enhanced version that people learning to read or who have problems reading can follow because of related photographs and simple language, as well as a version for people who don't. In addition, Text-to-Speech is available for those units that can use it. People who are learning English or who have disabilities limiting their reading may enjoy this title, as well as young English-speaking children.
