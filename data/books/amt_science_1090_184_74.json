It is enough to get by, but not enough to change anyone's life.  Even the wizards are simply people who have trained all their lives.  The man known only as Bishop is one of these ordinary people, but he will discover the hidden world that the Pure would rather everyone remain unaware of....For all are descended from the Pure.  With power to engulf an entire city in flames, should they be a Pure Fire.  A Pure Water can call the flood, Pure Air the storm, Pure Earth the quake.  And a Pure Mind could own everyone within the city walls without them even being aware of it.  It's said they are the gods reincarnated, but they act just as other people.  Should they bear children, that child has but a fraction of their power, and a mixing of their domains: Steamlings are the offspring of Fire and Water, Mudslingers that of Water and Earth.The Pure are hunted: their powers are as coveted as they are dangerous.  But they do not simply hide, not simply react.  They are planning.  Some plan for the betterment of their people.  Others plan only for their survival.  Many plan selfishly, to use their power to gain more power.And some plan to heave everything into the Void."}, {"id": "B00EA9E3FU", "genre": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "title": "Rotten Row", "description": "Rotten Row is the worst place we\u2019ve made.Humankind can travel to the stars \u2014 but only those content to be flung as a datastream through space, flitting from male to female, dark to fair, one random discard body to the next.
