L. Mencken noted that his discovery of this classic American novel was \"the most stupendous event of my whole life\"; Ernest Hemingway declared that \"all modern American literature stems from this one book,\" while T. S. Eliot called Huck \"one of the permanent symbolic figures of fiction, not unworthy to take a place with Ulysses, Faust, Don Quixote, Don Juan, Hamlet.\"The novel's preeminence derives from its wonderfully imaginative re-creation of boyhood adventures along the Mississippi River, its inspired characterization, the author's remarkable ear for dialogue, and the book's understated development of serious underlying themes: \"natural\" man versus \"civilized\" society, the evils of slavery, the innate value and dignity of human beings,\u00a0and other topics. Most of all, Huckleberry Finn is a wonderful story, filled with high adventure and unforgettable characters."}, {"id": "0822596644", "genre": "Children's Books", "title": "Chris Mullin: Sure Shot (Achievers)", "description": "Traces the life and career of Golden State Warrior Chris Mullin, looks at his college years at St. Johns, and describes how he has overcome alcoholism to reinvigorate his game"}, {"id": "0753460408", "genre": "Children's Books", "title": "Racing: The Ultimate Motorsports Encyclopedia", "description": "With more than seventy million fans, NASCAR is the number-one sport in the United States, and with interest in all aspects of motor racing reaching an all-time high, here is the perfect companion for all of those racing fans.
