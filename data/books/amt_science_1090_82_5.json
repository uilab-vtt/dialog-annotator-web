With a twofold aim to entertain and enlighten, Afrofuturists strive to break down racial, ethnic, and all social limitations to empower and free individuals to be themselves. This book introduces readers to the burgeoning artists creating Afrofuturist works, the history of innovators in the past, and the wide range of subjects they explore. From the sci-fi literature of Samuel Delaney, Octavia Butler, and NK Jemison to the musical cosmos of Sun Ra, George Clinton, and the Black Eye Peas Will.i.am, who debuted \"Reach for the Stars\" on Mars, to the visual and multimedia artists inspired by African Dogon myths and Egyptian deities. Topics range from the \"alien\" experience of blacks in America to the \"wake up\" cry peppering sci-fi literature, sermons, and activism. Interviews with rappers, composers, musicians, singers, authors, comic illustrators, painters, and DJs, as well as Afrofuturist professors, will provide a firsthand look at this fascinating movement.

Sarah Hall has been hailed as \"one of the most significant and exciting of Britain's young novelists\" (The Guardian), a writer whose \"intelligence and ambition are thrilling to behold\" (BookForum). Her work has been acclaimed as \"amazing...terrific and original\" (Washington Post). In this collection of nine works of short fiction, she uses her piercing insight to plumb the depth of the female experience and the human soul. A husband's wife transforms into a vulpine in \"Mrs. Fox\", winner of the BBC Short Story Prize. In \"Case Study 2\", a social worker struggles with a foster child raised in a commune. A new mother runs into an old lover in \"Luxury Hour\". In incandescent prose full of rich observations and striking clarity, Hall has composed nine wholly original pieces - works of fiction that will resonate long after the final word is heard. "}]
