An early adapter of modern baseball rules, Abner adored the sport and helped bring it into mainstream American sporting life. As a boy, he loved nothing more than playing ball\u2014whether it be \"one old cat\" or \"three old cat\"\u2014with his brother and friends. When not on the playing field, Abner sought out adventures, which led him to a historic meeting with the French Revolutionary War hero General Lafayette, the recovery of a stolen trunk in the woods, and a hitched ride aboard a rickety stagecoach. Even as a child, Abner displayed the leadership skills and good sportsmanship that helped him advance the rules of baseball and lead his soldiers into battle during the Mexican-American and Civil Wars. Special features include a summary of Abner's adult accomplishments, fun facts detailing little-known tidbits of information about him, and a time line of his life."}, {"id": "1580896529", "genre": "Children's Books", "title": "Goldy Luck and the Three Pandas", "description": "In this Chinese American retelling of \"Goldilocks and the Three Bears,\" a careless Goldy Luck wreaks havoc on the home of a family of panda bears.
