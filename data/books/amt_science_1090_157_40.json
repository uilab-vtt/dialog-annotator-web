The Book is divided into four main sections: 1) The Realm of Chaos, which describes the background and history of Chaos in the Warhammer 40,000 universe. 2) The Forces of Chaos, which has descriptions and rules of all the different followers of the Chaos Gods and their weaponry. 3) Slaves to Darkness, contains the Chaos Space Marine army list and special characters 4) The Lost and The Damned, where we cover a number of things related to Chaos in the Warhammer 40,000 universe, but which aren't included in the main rules or background. The book also includes two color sections: 16 pages of 'Eavy Metal and, at the back of the book, 16 pages of Wargear cards, Vehicle cards and Chaos Reward cards."}, {"id": "0385539835", "genre": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "title": "Bats of the Republic: An Illuminated Novel", "description": "\"Archetypes of the cowboy story, tropes drawn from sci-fi, love letters, diaries, confessions all abound in this relentlessly engaging tale.
