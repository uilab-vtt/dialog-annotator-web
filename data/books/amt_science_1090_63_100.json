But what bothers Watch Commander Sir Sam Vimes is that the unusual deaths of three elderly Ankh-Morporkians do not bear the clean, efficient marks of the Assassins' Guild.

The anger of a fearful populace is already being dangerously channeled toward the city's small community of golems\u2014the mindless, absurdly industrious creatures of baked clay, who can occasionally be found toiling in the city's factories. And certain highly placed personages are using the unrest as an excuse to resurrect a monarchy\u2014which would be bad enough even if the \"king\" they were grooming wasn't as empty-headed as your typical animated pottery."}, {"id": "B01D6SPARK", "genre": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "title": "Blackmark (The Kingsmen Chronicles #1): An Epic Fantasy Adventure", "description": "\u201cLike George RR Martin and Joe Abercrombie, Carlson writes in this genre for grown-ups, with flair and elegance.
