Jason hesitated again. This time, I wasn't worried. He was either going to follow me, or get back in the elevator by himself. I counted to three and smiled. The sound of footsteps hurrying after me usually gets that reaction. We walked together to the end of the hall to a door with a large sign bearing the name 'Gino's' in fancy script. I knocked and waited. The door ignored me so I knocked again. This time, it opened and the heavenly smell of frying hamburger drifted through the crack. Jason's eyes lit up brighter than the hall bulbs. I snickered, pushed the door open and walked into what had once been a living room. Jason followed me, stopped just inside the door and stared at the mystic symbols etched into the walls, his jaw hanging almost to his knees. I took my jacket off, tossed it to one side then cracked my knuckles and turned around. \"Welcome to Gino's.\" I grinned again, only this time not so nicely. His face turned the shade of French vanilla ice cream and he backed up. Right into the waiting arms of Gino himself. I smirked. \"You shoulda run when you had the chance.\" When Lynda passes her final exam with flying colors, she graduates into the elite world of Wizards. Unexpected side effects of her graduation spell, an evil wizard with designs on the city and a nosy mother complicate things.
