But his fragile peace is shattered when his old Master shows up to recruit him for a classic battle of good and evil. In order to succeed, he must team up with Lady Jorelial Rey, the spirited, dragon-riding regent of a kingdom in chaos, and they must convince the establishment to embrace decidedly unconventional methods of winning the fight! Together with an assortment of courageous allies -- dragons, unicorns, bards, talking beasts, and one very wild water sprite, the pair set about saving their homeland from a ruthless usurper, using their wits, creativity, and a sprinkling of magic. But will those be enough for the very last wizard of Eneri Clare, and his friends, to meet the daunting challenges ahead, and set the trajectory of history itself back on course?

In a society where dissidence is brutally punished and history is altered to suit the State, Winston Smith is one of the few people who still opposes the totalitarian regime which runs the country with an iron fist. The novel, which has been described as a \u201cmasterpiece\u201d by The Guardian, was written in 1948 (which is how the title came about: the reversal of the final two digits) and, after it was published the following year, went on not only to become a major success, but also to have a significant influence on the English language. George Orwell was a British writer who was born in British India in 1903.
