But possibly because of the success of the comic strip, television series, and feature films, the DENNIS THE MENACE comicbooks were never taken seriously by comic art critics. But all that changed when a DENNIS THE MENACE story was included in The Toon Treasury of Classic Children's Comics, edited by Art Spiegelman and Francoise Mouly. Only the finest kid's comics were included in that critically acclaimed collection, and now Papercutz continues to bring those great DENNIS THE MENACE comics back into print. This volume features the work of artist OWEN FITZGERALD whose work with writer FRED TOOLE is considered a high point of the series."}, {"id": "141765113X", "genre": "Children's Books", "title": "Tokyo Mew Mew, Volume 1 (Tokyo Mew Mew (Prebound))", "description": "An accident at a museum endows 11-year old Ichigo Momomiya with the DNA of wildcats.
