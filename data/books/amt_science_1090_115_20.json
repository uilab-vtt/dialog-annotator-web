Set on the moors of Scotland in the waning months of Arthur's rule, Three Days and Two Knights tells how Sir Alanbart, an impoverished and spineless knight; Heather, an indomitable and irresistible serving maid; Scot, a pagan swordsman of questionable intelligence and sexuality, and Sir Gawain, the legendary romantic hero, form an unlikely alliance to free King Arthur from prison. The catch? They have just three days before the blue moon rises, at which time the red wizard Rabordath will use Arthur's blood to conjure a dragon that will end a kingdom and set all of Britain aflame.\u00a0\nThree Days and Two Knights features characters, settings, artifacts and events drawn from medieval myth and history, and will appeal to anyone who loves the middle ages, knights, monsters, magic, or King Arthur, especially those who grew up with The Hobbit, Percy Jackson, and Cressida Cowell's How to Train Your Dragon series.\u00a0\n"}, {"id": "1933618698", "genre": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "title": "Edgar Allan Poe: Masters of the Weird Tale", "description": "Perhaps the finest, certainly one of the earliest, writers of classic weird tales, Edgar Allan Poe is sometimes overshadowed by twentieth-century practitioners.
