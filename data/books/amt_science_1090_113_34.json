Oft repeated was praise for the daring speed with which the King had stolen a march on the Norwegian\u2019s who had thought York to be safe from his reach.            The King\u2019s army had struck the Norwegian troops like a lightning bolt, catching the invaders completely by surprise while the Derwent River divided their army.  Waving charge after charge forward, Godwinson had battered them to pieces with his mighty cavalry.  Ultimately the shield wall had fractured, and the Norwegian infantry had been forced into launching an ill-fated counter-charge.  By the end of that day of heavy fighting, King Harald Hardraada of Norway would die from an arrow to throat, and Godwinson\u2019s brother Tostig would reap the traitors\u2019 death he deserved.  So complete was his victory, the invaders were virtually wiped out.          Upon learning of still another challenger to his throne landing to the south, Godwinson had left the paltry survivors of Hardraada\u2019s army to flee to from whence they came, and force-marched as many of his soldiers as he could to meet this new threat from Normandy\u2026"}, {"id": "B00NJV0548", "genre": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "title": "13: A Short Story Collection", "description": "If you need a fiction fix, but don\u2019t have the time to commit to a full novel, a short story collection like \"Thirteen\" is the perfect solution for a mental getaway.
