As a child, Ibn Sina was extremely bright, a voracious reader who loved to learn and was fortunate to have the best teachers. He memorized the Qur\u2019an by the age of ten and completed his medical studies at sixteen. He spent his life traveling, treating the sick, seeking knowledge through research, and writing about his discoveries. He came up with new theories in the fields of physics, chemistry, astronomy and education. His most famous work is The Canon of Medicine, a collection of books that were used for teaching in universities across the Islamic world and Europe for centuries. Ibn Sina\u2019s story, told in the first person and beautifully illustrated, provides a fascinating glimpse into the life of one of the great intellects of the past."}, {"id": "B00E78RWLG", "genre": "Children's Books", "title": "Adventures of a Mouse at Sea - The Navigator", "description": "...Cameron and Momma are swept out to sea and find themselves rescued by two human sailors and a cat.
