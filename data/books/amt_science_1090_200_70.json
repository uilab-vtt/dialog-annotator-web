He turns to the stories we generate and tell ourselves \u2013 via fiction, film journalism, theory \u2013 to see how change is registered. By investigating a variety of texts, he observes how structural change affects the way people organise their lives economically, socially and culturally. Case studies include Ridley Scott\u2019s Blade Runner, William Gibson\u2019s cyberspace trilogy, Thomas Pynchon\u2019s The Crying of Lot 49, and Wim Wenders\u2019s Until the End of the World.Using the links between narrative cultural forms and the process of historical understanding, he brings together debates that have so far been conducted largely within the separate domains of political economy, social theory and cultural criticism to provide a compelling analysis of contemporary cultural change. By relocating postmodernism in the context of changing modes of capitalism, Heffernan puts the question of class and class agency back at the centre of the critical agenda."}]
