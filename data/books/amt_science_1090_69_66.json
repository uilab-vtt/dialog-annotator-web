For example, Mother Nature, the celestial harmony, the great chain of being, and the book of nature, are used in natural science and in literature. These and other metaphors have a powerful influence on the framing of scientific hypothesis making, and these words have guided the history of natural science for several millennia. Each chapter in this book is a parallel longitudinal history of a word or phrase which represents the whole of nature, and which has influenced natural science and general literature, and especially North American nature writing."}, {"id": "1514275090", "genre": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "title": "2: The Adventures of Jack and Miracle Girl: Volume Two", "description": "It's been over six months since ordinary guy Jack Wright inexplicably found himself in a relationship with Signal City's most powerful and most famous superheroine, Miracle Girl.
