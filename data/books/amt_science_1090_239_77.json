[{"id": "1597809160", "genre": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "title": "Bash Bash Revolution", "description": "A compelling coming-of-age artificial intelligence novel from Philip K. Dick Award-nominated author Douglas Lain.  Seventeen-year-old Matthew Munson is ranked thirteenth in the state in Bash Bash Revolution, an outdated video game from 2002 that, in 2017, is still getting tournament play. He\u2019s a high school dropout who still lives at home with his mom, doing little but gaming and moping. That is, until Matthew\u2019s dad turns up again.  Jeffrey Munson is a computer geek who\u2019d left home eight years earlier to work on a top secret military project. Jeff has been a sporadic presence in Matthew\u2019s life, and much to his son\u2019s displeasure insists on bonding over video games. The two start entering local tournaments together, where Jeff shows astonishing aptitude for Bash Bash Revolution in particular.  Then, as abruptly as he appeared, Matthew\u2019s father disappears again, just as he was beginning to let Jeff back into his life.  The betrayal is life-shattering, and Matthew decides to give chase, in the process discovering the true nature of the government-sponsored artificial intelligence program his father has been involved in. Told as a series of conversations between Matthew and his father\u2019s artificial intelligence program, Bash Bash Revolution is a wildly original novel of apocalypse and revolution, as well as a poignant story of broken family."}, {"id": "B01CO65KUM", "genre": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "title": "Hunted (Alex Beckett #1)", "description": "The year is 2201, but utopia is distant memory.
