On the outside, in white paint, were these words: Hana Brady, May 16, 1931, and Waisenkind \u2013 the German word for orphan. Children who saw the suitcase on display were full of questions. Who was Hana Brady? What happened to her? They wanted Fumiko Ishioka, the center\u2019s curator, to find the answers. In a suspenseful journey, Fumiko searches for clues across Europe and North America. The mystery of the suitcase takes her back through seventy years, to a young Hana and her family, whose happy life in a small Czech town was turned upside down by the invasion of the Nazis. \u201cLike the very best of museum exhibits, Hana\u2019s Suitcase shows how facts and objects can be put together to honour its subject in a very personal and loving way.
