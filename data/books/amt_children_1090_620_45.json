I researched a lot of activities for my child that would help her develop and that would also be fun. I combined activities that I found in different resources into one bundle, added some of our own activities and I'm sharing these activities with other moms that don't have time to do extensive research. All the activities in the book have been tested on our toddler, and I only included those that she liked. The target group for these activities is 12 to 18-month-old toddlers, but I think 18 to 24 month olds would enjoy them as well. All kids are different though, and if your child is not interested in some activities, try them again later. Kids develop and change their interests so fast!
