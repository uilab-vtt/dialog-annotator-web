A catastrophic electromagnetic pulse, now known as the Surge, pulled the plug on society and left millions of unprepared people in darkness, panic, and mayhem. But the party is just beginning for the bloodthirsty gangs; Ferrari-driving demonic cults; former virtual reality addicts called deadheads; and last but not least, the Vagabonds -- artificially intelligent robots with a psychotic obsession to be the only survivors of the human race. In this world of shadow and fire, fourteen-year-old Benedict Knight carries the immense burden of protecting his fellow orphans at his family's hidden desert retreat. The Knights had prepared for TEOTWAWKI, but with seventeen mouths to feed, supplies are running dangerously low. It's been a year since the Surge, and Ben is on the run from killer machines after a daring night mission ends with tragedy. On a remote stretch of highway, he happens upon the mysterious Stranger, who has a startling revelation about the Knight family that could change the course of history. Or so he says.

The CPE has the know-how of twentieth century technology but needs iron and steel to make the machines. The iron mines of the upper Palatinate were rendered inoperable by wartime damage, and American know-how is needed on the spot to pump them out and get the metal flowing again - a mission that will prove more complicated than anyone expects. In the maelstrom that is Europe, even a twentieth-century copy of the Encyclopedia Britannica can precipitate a crisis when readers learn of the 1640 Portuguese revolt, a crisis that will involve Naples as well. Another factor: Albanian exiles in Naples, inspired by the Americans, are plotting to recover lost Albanian turf, which will precipitate yet another crisis in the Balkans. This troubled century was full of revolutions and plans for more revolutions before the Americans arrived and gave every would-be revolutionary an example of a revolution that succeeded. Europe is a pot coming to a boil, and Mike Stearns will have his hands full seeing that it doesn't boil over on to Grantville and the CPE."}]
