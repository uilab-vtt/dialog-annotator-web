I Promise I'll Find You is a moving story that parents will love reading to and sharing with their children again and again.  The fear of being separated from loved ones is a universal emotion. Consider a child who feels lost -- wandering away from home, becoming separated in a crowd, or feeling frightened in a new and strange place?  I Promise I'll Find You is a perennial favorite of parents and children alike; it's like a comforting hug, a warm lap, a reassuring kiss, and the enveloping arms of a parent who pledges, no matter what happens: \"I promise I'll find you.\"  In eleven warm and simple verses, Heather Patricia Ward delivers a timeless message of reassurance. Sheila McGraw's imaginative illustrations show a devoted mother and an amusing dog as they search the world over for a lost child: at sea, in the city, over mountains, and even in outer space.  Together, parents and children will enjoy the gentle language and the calm, reassuring pictures of this thoughtful and important book.
