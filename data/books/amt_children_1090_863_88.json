It is a time when world-renowned artist Rembrandt van Rijn is at the height of fame among his patrons\u2015and when his young son Titus longs to imitate his father and become a great painter. At first, Rembrandt rebuffs Titus\u2019s attempts at drawing, telling the boy he is too young to learn art. But gradually, the master painter is won over by his son\u2019s enthusiasm and persistence, and he begins to teach a very happy Titus the basic techniques of drawing from life. Here is a warmhearted story for children, with illustrations that capture the atmosphere of seventeenth-century Holland and suggest some of the genius that radiates from Rembrandt\u2019s own magnificent paintings."}, {"id": "0786852607", "genre": "Children's Books", "title": "Sugar Plum Ballerinas #1: Plum Fantastic", "description": "Alexandrea Petrakova Johnson does not want to be a beautiful ballerina, and she does not want to leave her friends in Apple Creek.
